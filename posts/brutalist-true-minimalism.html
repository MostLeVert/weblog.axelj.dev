   <h1>Brutalist true-minimalism</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>
    Brutalist true-minimalism is a design philosophy that, through the failings of brutalism and minimalism, reconciles the salient aspects of both into a new design principle that departs from both philosophies and synthesizes a new philosophy that underscores the importance of truth to both intention and function. That is, exposes the need for the function (true minimalism), while doing so in an unapologetic way, brutalism.
   </p>
   <h2>An Example</h2>
   <p>
    A house that conforms to the principles of brutalist true minimalism must have exposed wiring and plumbing within the interior, it may not have hollow walls. The house must not have any ulterior design decisions. It may not have such things as cantilevers that exist for the sake of existing. To achieve the shape of the house we must analysis the environment that the house is in, this includes the orientation to the cardinal directions.
