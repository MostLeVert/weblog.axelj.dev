      <h1>Brutalist True Minimalism</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Brutalist true-minimalism is a design philosophy that provides an escape from the modern bastardization of "minimalism" -- the trendiness of which ruined the true philosophy. My design movement aims to bring back the true point of minimalism, that is, reducing clutter, physically, but arguably more importantly, mentally. This is the "true minimalism" aspect. The brutalist aspect comes more in the form of design, rather, as I've said before, the development aspect. In a house that conforms to this new paradigm all wiring and plumbing would need to be exposed, and meticulously designed to be as optimal as possible, leaving the walls solid and without infrastructure. While this might initially appear to defy the ethos of minimalism, it is my argument that it better exercises that ethos. However, due the public connotation of the word "minimalism" I choose to call this "true minimalism". To highlight the current state of minimalism and brutalism. If one does an internet search for these terms they will be met with architecturally complex interior, interiors with random empty vases, etc., this defies both the pure function aspect of brutalism AND the less is more aspect of minimalism. Brutalist true minimalism reconciles these fails by introducing more into the space through conforming to the aspect of brutalism focusing on function and the aspect of true minimalism of not hiding anything. Thus the brutalist true minimalist's house has much in it, but also very little, in different ways; we expose the functional elements, reduce the superfluous ones; resulting in a look that brings the most salient elements of true minimalist together with the functional choices of brutalism.
