    <h1>Brutalist True-Minimalism</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <!-- <p>
      Brutalist true-minimalism is a design philosophy that provides an escape from the modern bastardization of
      "minimalism" -- the trendiness of which ruined the true philosophy. My design movement aims to bring back the
      true point of minimalism, that is, reducing clutter, physically, but arguably more importantly, mentally. This
      is the "true minimalism" aspect. The brutalist aspect comes more in the form of design, rather, as I've said
      before, the development aspect. In a house that conforms to this new paradigm all wiring and plumbing would need
      to be exposed, and meticulously designed to be as optimal as possible, leaving the walls solid and without
      infrastructure. While this might initially appear to defy the ethos of minimalism, it is my argument that it
      better exercises that ethos. However, due the public connotation of the word "minimalism" I choose to call this
      "true minimalism". To highlight the current state of minimalism and brutalism. If one does an internet search
      for these terms they will be met with architecturally complex interior, interiors with random empty vases, etc.,
      this defies both the pure function aspect of brutalism AND the less is more aspect of minimalism. Brutalist true
      minimalism reconciles these fails by introducing more into the space through conforming to the aspect of
      brutalism focusing on function and the aspect of true minimalism of not hiding anything. Thus the brutalist true
      minimalist's house has much in it, but also very little, in different ways; we expose the functional elements,
      reduce the superfluous ones; resulting in a look that brings the most salient elements of true minimalist
      together with the functional choices of brutalism.

      Brutalist true-minimalism provides a novel combination of two well known paradigms of design, brutalism and minimalism, it seeks to reinvigorate the original motives of those philosophies. Brutalist true-minimalism is a critique of the direction modern minimalism and brutalism have taken through the integration of superfluous elements that violate the ethos. Modern brutalist houses tend to actually be more minimalist than the modern minimalists house -- but they introduce architectural elements that are nothing more than designs; not bad, but certainly not in line with the original movement. While modern brutalism has maintained its roots, modern minimalism has almost entirely departed from the original ethos. Through the rabid commodification of the principles the word and ethos have become watered down and ubiquitous. I'm not against progression of movements, I just seek to extract the ultimate value in the distillation of the ethos of the two philosophies at their confluence. To summarize the reason for my founding of brutalist true-minimalism I'd like to say: The modern minimalist's house useless trinkets, or design elements, likes stones or books that haven't been read -- it hides the functional elements of a building in the walls, pushing their conscience, both as their own, and in the owner, into the edges of the building. This contributes to a great clutter. Meanwhile the modern brutalist house also hides those, what are in the modern world considered nuisances within the walls or floors, the modern brutalist introduces unnecessary architectural elements for the sake of having sharp lines. This is because the modern brutalist is afraid of the true reality of brutalism as a stark, depressing, purely functional entity. Brutalist true-minimalism pulls the airy, friendly ethos of minimalism together with the pure function of brutalism, and in doing so, interesting phenomena of design arise, e.g. in brutalist true-minimalism the pipes and wiring of a building must be exposed on the interior and meticulously organized to bring out their pure function, and by not hiding them, the true-minimalism of it is exposed. In this way the brutalist true-minimalist will reduce their unnecessary bathrooms, electrical outlets, etc., a key part of the unique, novel, aspect of this confluence. We can observe new things arise from known things; which, as an anecdote, is the function of the human mind.
